## What this is

A single-file prototype for a university entrepreneurship class: an app that connects
ผู้ทิ้ง (residents with recyclables) to ซาเล้ง (informal collectors) in Bangkok.

Business idea in one line: a saleng makes money on recyclables (ขวด PET, ลัง/กระดาษ,
กระป๋อง, ขวดแก้ว). If the household also has ขยะทั่วไป / เศษอาหาร, they pay an extra
**service fee** for the saleng to haul it to a BMA (กทม.) drop-off site. Recyclable pickup
is only worth the trip above a threshold (currently 15 kg), so waste is pooled at
walk-to drop points.

## Files

- `index.html` — the interactive prototype (mobile-first, one 430px phone frame).
- `wireframe.html` — a desktop **showcase board**: 7 non-interactive mobile screens side by
  side, a "feedback → changes" grid above, numbers + interview questions below, and a sticky jump-nav. This is the design artefact for class discussion.
- `theme.css` — **shared** design tokens + base styles + wireframe/map/phone-board CSS.
  Both pages link it; change a color here, not in the pages.
- `README.md`, `.gitignore` — housekeeping.

No build step, no install. Open either HTML directly in a browser, or serve the folder
(`python -m http.server`) — `theme.css` is a relative link so both work.

## Structure

### `theme.css`
1. CSS custom properties define the whole palette (`--ink`, `--accent`, `--warn`,
   `--mat-*`, …), redefined for dark mode under both `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
   and `:root[data-theme="dark"]`. **Always use these tokens; never hard-code a hex.**
2. Helpers `.disp` / `.mono` / `.eyebrow`, and `.frame` — the phone frame used by
   `index.html`. Its desktop centering is scoped to `body.app`, so `index.html` must keep
   `<body class="app">` and `wireframe.html` must not have it.
3. `.wf-*` (dashed wireframe boxes, fake buttons, checkboxes, skeletons), `.map` / `.pin`
   / `.me` (hand-drawn map + pins), `.board` / `.phone-*` / `.tabbar` / `.jump`
   (showcase board) — used by `wireframe.html` only.

### `index.html`
Tailwind via CDN (`cdn.tailwindcss.com`) with `tailwind.config` mapping the CSS variables
to utility color names (`bg-surface`, `text-muted`, `border-line`, …). Two `<main>` views
inside the `.frame`, switched by the header tablist; the third tab is a plain link out to
`wireframe.html`:
- `#view-resident` — ผู้ทิ้ง: nearest drop point, kg toward the threshold, price table.
- `#view-collector` — ซาเล้ง: worth-it job queue, accept/en-route state.

One IIFE at the bottom holds all state: `points`, `MATS` prices, `THRESHOLD`, `setRole()`,
and `render*()` functions that rebuild innerHTML. Both views share the same `points` array,
so adding waste as a resident immediately changes the collector's queue — that is the
demo's punchline, keep it working.

### `wireframe.html`
Round 2, reworked from peer feedback. `#feedback` maps each feedback point to screen links
(`.scr-link`). Seven `<article class="phone-anchor">` cards in `.board`, each = caption +
`.chg` note ("เดิม: …", what changed) + role chip + `.phone-frame` (status bar → appbar →
scrollable `.phone-body` → fake `.tabbar`).
Flow: 1 two-question request (ผู้ทิ้ง) · 2 small amount → drop point / scheduled round (ผู้ทิ้ง) ·
3 waiting + call (ผู้ทิ้ง) · 4 route with trip profit (ซาเล้ง) · 5 big-type one-job mode (ซาเล้ง) ·
6 weigh with steppers + one cash number (ซาเล้ง) · 7 receipt + value + 👍👎 (ผู้ทิ้ง).
Below the board: `#numbers` (worked example for one 15 kg stop; shop prices = `MATS` in
`index.html`; household buy prices and the ฿15/bag fee are assumptions) and `#research`
(interview questions). Keep the ฿50 / ฿74 / ฿150 figures consistent across screens 4–7 and the table.

## Conventions

- Plain ES5-flavoured JS, no framework, no modules, no build. Keep it that way.
- Thai is the primary UI language; secondary English labels are muted/smaller.
- `wireframe.html` is deliberately fake: its buttons are `<div class="wf-btn">`, not
  `<button>`, so nothing looks clickable-but-broken. It has no JavaScript at all.
  Do not wire it up unless asked.
- Maps are hand-drawn inline SVG (blocks, roads, park, canal) with HTML pins positioned
  in percentages on top — no map library, no tiles, no network calls.
- Both light and dark themes must stay legible; check any new color in both.
